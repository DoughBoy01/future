• Sleeping bag or bed roll (and a fitted sheet if you’re fancy)
• Pill ow (yes, you’ll miss it if you don’t bring it)
• 5–7 sets of clothes — comfy, washable, and ready for mud
• Warm jumper or hoodie (nights get chilly, even heroes get cold)
• Rain jacket or poncho (because nature doesn’t care about your plans)
• Underwear and socks (more than you think you’ll need)
• Trainers or walking shoes
• Flip-flops or slides (for showers and pool time)
• Pyjamas
• Hat or cap for sun protection
• Reusable water bottle

🙌 Behaviour & Conduct

• Treat everyone — campers, staff, and squirrels — with respect.
• No bullying, teasing, or “funny” pranks that make someone else miserable.

👦👧 Age & Participation
