# Admin Dashboard - Quick Guide

## 🎯 What's New?

Your admin dashboard has been redesigned to be cleaner, more intuitive, and focused on what matters.

## 📊 Main Dashboard

### 1. Key Metrics (Top Section)
Four essential metrics in large cards:
- **Revenue** - Total earnings + registration count
- **Active Camps** - Currently published camps
- **Registrations** - Total bookings + this week's trend
- **Customers** - Total parent accounts

**Why only 4?** Less overwhelming, focus on what matters most.

### 2. Needs Your Attention (Smart Alerts)
This section automatically shows items requiring action:

**🔴 Pending Payments** - Payments waiting to be processed
**🟡 Open Enquiries** - Customer questions needing responses
**🔵 Draft Camps** - Camps ready to publish

**No alerts?** You'll see a green "All caught up!" message 🎉

**Click any alert** → Go directly to that page

### 3. Quick Links (Card Grid)
Six most-used features as visual cards:

1. **Manage Camps** - Create, edit, publish camps
2. **Registrations** - Track bookings and payments
3. **Enquiries** - Respond to customer questions
4. **Customers** - View and manage parents
5. **Analytics** - View reports and insights
